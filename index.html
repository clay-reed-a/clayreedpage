				I'm Clayton Albachten, a poet and software engineer.

				My passion is for front-end technologies. User interfaces,
				graphical trickery and making the pixels do whatever I want them to.

				Usually this involves lots of JavaScript.

				But my skills are more general than that.

				I like the New York School of Poets and abstract expressionism. I like loose leaf tea, house plants, my Nintendo Switch, rocks and bones. I like the sky, as should everyone.

				I like it when I write elegant, eloquent code.
				I like to build things that let us grow stronger.
				I probably like you too.
