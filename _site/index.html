		<small>*Unless you want to print this page &amp; cut out the picture of me along the dotted line.</small>
		<small id="message">Once you have successfully cut out my picture, use an adhesive to affix my picture to your forehead. Walk around imitating my mannerisms &amp; talking about subjects I usually talk about. Once the adhesive has worn off &amp; the picture has fallen from your forehead, return to behaving in your usual way. Try supplying a group of friends w/ their own pictures of me, and, having instructed them on their use, all affix your Clayton pictures to your foreheads together!</small>
