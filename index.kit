		<small>*Unless you want to print the page <br /> &amp; cut out this picture of me along the dotted line.</small>
		<small id="message">Once you have successfully cut out my picture, use an adhesive to affix my picture to a wall in your house. Whenever you see this picture, for the duration of time you are in its sight, imitate my mannerisms &amp; talk about subjects I usually talk about. If you find yourself feeling comfortable w/ this ritual, attempt also thinking however you imagine I think. Whosoever lives in or enters your house should be instructed as to the purpose of this object. Try experimenting w/ placing it in different locations in the house, such as an obscure corridor, in a room reserved for guests, or near the TV or radio. This modest system can be a subtle but powerful tool for bringing about change in your life.</small>
